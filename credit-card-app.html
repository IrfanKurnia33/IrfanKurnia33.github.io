								<h2 style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">The Problem</h2>
								<p>It started as a personal problem. When I have to make a big purchase but don't want to exhaust my credit card limit, I tend to request that my payment is changed into installments.</p>
								<p>The current credit card app that I'm using has problems. The UI seems outdated, lacking hierarchy, and it's hard to know if I did the right thing on the app to split my large payment into installments.</p>
								<hr />
								<h2 style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Making Credit Cards Easier to Handle for Millennials and Gen Z</h2>
								<p>Today it's only ordinary for banks to acquire new customers by developing a mobile app to keep up with millennials and Gen Zers entering the workforce. Since the smartphone is a permanent fixture of nearly every activity we do, it is no wonder that banking is one of the things that should be done at their fingertips.</p>
								<p>As a part of this cohort, I consider banking (the traditional one) as tedious and often overwhelming. From my own experiences and other people's, it is not a hard decision to leave a bank solely because their app is painful to use.</p>
								<hr />
								<h2 style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">My Role</h2>
								<p>As the sole UX researcher and designer, I conducted an end-to-end UX process from research to design. I used the secondary research method and gathered data from various reliable sources such as academic papers, credible reviews, etc.</p>
								<p>These are the preliminary research questions I came up with to kickstart the research process:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>What are the current features offered by the app?</li>
									<li>What are the current challenges users are facing with the existing mobile app design?</li>
									<li>What are the most common user complaints and praises about the existing design?</li>
								</ul>
								<hr />
								<h2 style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Problem Space</h2>
								<h3 style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Mainly perceived as Inconvenient</h3>
								<p>The first thing I did in this project is reading reviews from Google Play Store. There are many horrendous reviews about the app as a whole. But in this case study, I want to focus on one feature of the app. The "Convert to Installments" feature enables users to split their full payment into installments.</p>
								<p>Here are some examples of those reviews and you can tell immediately tell that the app is quite bad.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/cs2/app_reviews.jpg" alt="Redesigning installment request UX and UI on credit card app" /></span>
								<h2 style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Usability Issues</h2>
								<p>I conducted quick usability testing sessions with 5 users of the app. Needless to say, I found some critical usability issues at each step of the installment request process. I also created a <a href="#persona" class="scrolly">persona</a> based on the test. I describe the problems in this short video:</p>

								<h2 style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;" id="persona">User Persona & Design Challenges</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/cs2/userpersona.png" alt="Redesigning installment request UX and UI on credit card app" /></span>
								<p>From the tests and the user persona, here are the design challenges:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>How might we create a simple but effective experience for customers?</li>
									<li>How might we communicate instructions and information clearly to users?</li>
									<li>How might we increase user satisfaction to prevent churn?</li>
								</ul>
								<hr />
								<h2 style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;" id="ideation">Initial Ideation & Design Decisions</h2>
								<p>I moved quickly through an interactive design process, combining paper and digital prototyping, testing prototypes with users, and receiving feedback from users and domain experts.</p>
								<p>The iteration process gives valuable insight. Some changes are implemented for improved overall usability.</p>
								<h3 style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Initial Ideation for UI Improvement</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/cs2/initial_ideation.png" alt="Redesigning installment request UX and UI on credit card app" /></span>
								<ul>
									<li><strong>Bigger & more visible header:</strong> The current design did not stand out at the top of the information hierarchy. So it needs a clear indication of what features the user is in at the time.</li>
									<li><strong>More (proper) whitespace:</strong> The current design lacks proper whitespace, creating confusion regarding the proximity between elements that should be separated.</li>
									<li><strong>Clearer "Selected" state:</strong> Users weren't sure if the elements they selected were actually "selected", giving uncertainty for them.</li>
									<li><strong>Disabled button:</strong> When no data is selected, the button appears available to click. Users should be blocked from continuing to the next step before filling in mandatory fields.</li>
									<li><strong>Credit card info at the bottom:</strong> The credit card info is always displayed at the bottom of the page. Preventing anxiety of requesting installments for the wrong card.</li>
								</ul>
								<hr />
								<h2 style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">UI Improvements</h2>
								<p>Due to time constraints, I was only able to conduct the UI audit with the domain experts and quickly moved to the high-fidelity prototyping phase.</p>
								<p>Per the previous <a href="#ideation" class="scrolly">ideation notes</a>, I managed to redesign the whole user interface.</p>

								<hr />
								<h2 style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Full UI Demonstration</h2>
								<p>Here is the full demonstration of the improved user interface:</p>
								<video width="100%" controls>

								</video>
								<hr />
								<h2 style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Validation</h2>
								<p>I conducted usability testing sessions again with the same users. I used the single usability metric scorecard (developed by Jeff Sauro, Ph.D.) to measure effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.</p>
								<ul>
									<li><strong>The original design:</strong> People finished their tasks with an average of <strong>6 errors</strong> during the journey. And it took <strong>6 minutes 28 seconds (on average)</strong> to finish the installment request procedure.</li>
									<li><strong>The redesign:</strong> People finished their tasks on their own <strong>without errors</strong>. And it took only <strong>2 minutes</strong> to finish the registration process. <strong>69% decrease in the installment request procedure</strong>.</li>
									<li>Users' subjective satisfaction with the new design (4.8/5) was 300% higher than the original system (1.2/5).</li>
								</ul>
								<h3 style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">User feedback:</h3>
								<blockquote>"It's super clean and concise now! I can finish the installment request process way faster than the last time."</blockquote>
								<blockquote>"At every step of the process, there's always this anxiety of getting the data all wrong. But now I can proceed with speed and confidence."</blockquote>
								<hr />
								<h2 style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Challenges and Future Improvements</h2>
								<p>The biggest challenge for this project was the time constraint. I tried to simulate a rapid development process to achieve greater usability in the shortest amount of time. The project was done in just a month. But I believe if there's more time, the overall design could be better.</p>
								<p>The takeaway of this project is that users need a clear information hierarchy before proceeding with anything confidently. We need to make banking less tedious and overwhelming for the customers to prevent churn and loss of profit.</p>
								<p>And since this is a research-focused case study, I am well aware that the user interface's aesthetics could be improved. Especially amongst younger customers, the aesthetic-usability effect is stronger. If I work together with a specialized UI designer, perhaps the final high-fidelity prototype would look way better.</p>
								<p>The users I talked to are really helpful in getting the necessary insights. I am glad that the design upgrade is perceived positively by the users.</p>
